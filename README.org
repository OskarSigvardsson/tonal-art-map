* Tonal art map implementation for unity
I wanted to try and make an implementation of the Tonal Art Map
technique described in [[http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/hatching/hatching.pdf][this paper]] and this is the result. I wasn't
totally blown away by the result, so I decided to move on to something
different, but the effect can look pretty nice when applied to
something like a flag:

The idea is that things like lighting and shading shouldn't look how a
computer renders them, with gradient colors, but more how an artist
that does hatching would do it, with varying the amount of hatches.
This version integrates with Unity's standard lighting pipeline and
applies the tonal art map as the final step, so that it can benefit
from the calculation of the lighting.

The project includes both a generator that generates the tonal art map
as well as a shader that can render it.
